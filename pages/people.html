        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People is a web app created for people to manage and organize their interpersonal (social) relationships, which is done through organizing people into tags, groups, and events. The main objective of this fullstack development project was to practice and solidify my frontend CSS skills and backend database querying skills. This web app contains many CSS tricks I learned and applied, such as animations, carousels, and SVG icon manipulation. People is still in development.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web application wise, People is a web app thought for helping its users to be able to visualize their relationships with the people they know. People added into the web application can be sorted into groups, tags, genders, and events and be assigned relationship points. If the user wants to visualize the people he needs or wants to work his/her personal relationship with, he/she can view the relationship the person in question has and the notes about what he/she has lived with the person. In addition, the user can append notes to each person he adds into the People web app, in order to better be able to remember what he/she has talked about with the person in question and be able to better improve his/her relationship with the person with the help of the notes.</p>
