        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Inventorize is an inventory management desktop application with a built-in sale registering system and user sale commission reporting for the administrator. It is a Windows Desktop application primarily made to suit the client's (a doctor) needs for managing his product inventory and automatically calculating his secretaries' commissions for sales they make on their account.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventorize allows the standard user (secretary) to view the inventory and search for specific products in the inventory and sell them through selecting them in the inventory or through their product id and generating a ticket/receipt for sale for the client. The admin user (doctor) is able to add, edit, and disable products to and in the inventory. In addition, the admin user can also create categories for the products and tell the program how much each product costs and for how much each product will be sold, so that the program can calculate the profit per sale for each product and update the product's prices. The admin can also create, edit, and delete users and export the users, inventory, and sales with a commission report to excel files on his computer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program can be used by any small to medium business that has an inventory and would like an inventory management system that calculates commissions for the sellers of their products automatically, and that in addition allows their sellers to sell and log the products.</p>
